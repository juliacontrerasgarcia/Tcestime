TcESTIME is written in Python3, and needs the following packages to
function:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas

* Run TcESTIME *

Before running TcESTIME, make sure that to set the PYTHONPATH to the folder containing the TcESTIME.py file.

TcESTIME estimates the networking value of a system from its ELF cube
file, through the use of critic2 (stable version). If said cube file 
is located in /ex-dir/ex1.ELF.cube, TcESTIME is 
launched by

python3 TcESTIME.py /ex-dir/ex1.ELF.cube --opt OPT

The different command line options are:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --hdos HDOS        H_DOS fraction value to be considered for T_c.
  --odir ODIR        Directory for output files.
  --critic2 CRITIC2  Path to critic executable.
  --plot PLOT        Plot network of critical points. Default is False.


If HDOS is not specified, only the networking value \phi is computed.
If ODIR is not specified, all the output files are saved in the same 
directory as the cube file. As for now, we recommend using absolute 
paths. 

TcESTIME has the option of installing critic2 if it is not already in
the system. An interactive interface will ask the user if they would
like to install it automatically after running the program.

It is also possible to provide a critic output file, in case the user 
would like to use another version of critic2 (development critic2-1.1 
is also supported), adjust certain parameters in the running of critic2,
etcetera. TcESTIME recognizes these cases by the extension of the file
in the command line, which should be ".out". Then, the program is 
launched by

python3 TcESTIME.py /ex-dir/ex1.critic.out --opt OPT

The output of TcESTIME is a standard output message containing the found
networking value, as well as the critical temperature and hydrogen 
fraction in the case that HDOS was provided.
